(The gif is intentionally misplaced. Just like our brains in this hackathon)

Welcome to **UR Cooked**, the ultimate food ordering assistant that ensures you never waste time on food delivery websites. This project is designed to keep you on track and make sure you order your food quickly and efficiently. If you linger too long, UR Cooked will take matters into its own hands!

## Use of Github

### In the spirity hackathon

So we created our own database in Github lol.

### Version Control

We used GitHub for version control to keep track of all changes made to the project. This allowed us to collaborate efficiently and ensure that all team members were working on the latest version of the code.

### GitHub CLI

The GitHub CLI was used to manage our repository from the command line. This made it easy to perform common tasks such as cloning the repository, creating branches, and pushing changes.

### Project Management

We used GitHub Projects to manage our tasks and track progress. This helped us stay organized and ensure that all features were implemented on time.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions were used to automate our workflows. This included running tests, building the project, and deploying updates. This ensured that our code was always in a deployable state.

### GitHub Issues

We used GitHub Issues to track bugs and feature requests. This allowed us to prioritize our work and ensure that all issues were addressed in a timely manner.


## Features

- **Timer**: Keeps track of how long you've been on the page.
- **Notifications**: Sends you hilarious notifications if you take too long.
- **Auto-Redirect**: Redirects you to the restaurants page if you linger on the homepage.
- **Random Restaurant Selection**: Picks a random restaurant for you if you take too long to decide.
- **Auto-Add to Cart**: Adds random items to your cart if you haven't added anything.
- **Progressive Red Tinge**: The page gets progressively redder the longer you take.
- **Spinning Blahaj**: A Blahaj image that becomes more visible over time.
- **Roulette Game**: A fun roulette game on the checkout page where you can win or lose items in your cart.

8. **Roulette Game**: On the checkout page, you can play a roulette game to win or lose items in your cart.
